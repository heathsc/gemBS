First release of gemBS-rs, a complete rewrite of the gemBS pipeline (apart from the mapper) in Rust bringing increased
stability while maintaining the high performance of gemBS: https://github.com/heathsc/gemBS-rs.git

gemBS
=====
gemBS is a high performance bioinformatic pipeline designed for highthroughput analysis
of DNA methylation data from whole genome bisulfites sequencing data
(WGBS). It combines GEM3, a high performance read aligner and
bs_call, a high performance variant and methyation caller, into a streamlined and efficient pipeline for
bisulfite sequence analysis.

The manuscript describing the pipeline is available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/11/201988)

Licensing

Download
--------

Use ``git clone --recursive`` to retrieve the complete source code including the code from external projects such as ``bs_call`` and ``gem3-mapper``.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/heathsc/gemBS.git

------------
Installation
------------

1) Before starting the installation of gemBS, you will need to install
or check the installation of several packages.

  a) gcc with development libraries
  b) python3, pip3, matplotlib, multiprocess
  c) zlib, lzma, openssl, libcurl, libncurses, wget, pigz
  
If you are working on a clean (fairly recent) Ubuntu installation, you
can install everything required with the followiwg commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python3 build-essential git python3-pip wget pigz
    sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev
    sudo apt-get install -y libncurses5-dev liblzma-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    pip3 install matplotlib multiprocess

2) Download the gemBS distribution if you haven't already done so:

    ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/heathsc/gemBS.git``

3) Use python install command:

To install to the standard system location (i.e., so that all users
can use gemBS):

    ``python3 setup.py install``

To install to the user's home directory:

    ``python3 setup.py install --user``

Changelog:
----------
    3.5.5 Fix logging bug caused by trimming change in 3.5.3
    3.5.4 Fix bug in the output of strand specific cpg txt files (not
          encode Bed files) where the 'C' entry was not being printed
    3.5.3 Allow for read end specific trimming in bs_call
    3.5.3 Enable range checks and asserts in bs_call all target; add bs_call debug target
    3.5.2 Correct problems with gcc10.  Move to htslib/samtools/bcftools version 1.11
    3.5.1 Check if C compiler requires --std=c99 flag for standards conformant behaviour
    3.5.1 Make sure bgzip is copied correctly during installation
    3.5.0 Make bs_call process contig pools from largest to smallest (this change alters the sqlite db format so
          if you have a previously started gemBS run you should (a) remove the .gemBS directory, (b) redo the
          'gemBS prepare' step to recreate the db file and (3) run 'gemBS db-sync'. 
    3.5.0 Switch bs_call and snpxtr to use the new dbSNP index format
    3.5.0 Add ability of dbSNP to read the new JSON and VCF  dbSNP format files
          that are now used for human and non-human species respectively
    3.5.0 Add multithreading to dbSNP_idx
    3.5.0 Change format of dbSNP index to allow (a) efficient loading
          of SNP data for individual contigs and (b) parallel index creation 
    3.5.0 Rewrite mextr and snpxtr as standalone tools rather than
          bcftools plugins.  Now multithreaded and (relatively) memoryefficient
    3.5.0 Replace bedToBigBed and wigToBigWig to reduce memory usage
          and improve speed
    3.4.5 Fix crash when using the -k (keep-mismatch) flag, and fix rare hangs at end of processing
    3.4.4 Sort input bcf files to bcftools concat stage to ensure reproducibility.
    3.4.4 Add extra sort keys when generating pools to ensure stability of pool membership in the event of multiple contigs
          having the same size
    3.4.3 Remove calculation of the goodness of filter (GOF) as this is expensive, non-standard and unreliable.  Removing this
          removes the dependency on GSL.
    3.4.3 Add autodetection of output format to bs_call (unless explicitly specified on the command line)
    3.4.2 Add CRAM support (via make_cram option in configuration file)
    3.4.1 Add benchmark-mode that does not write date or program version numbers into SAM/BAM or VCF/BCF files
          Switch to samtools, bcftools and htslib v1.10
    3.4.0 Move to new bs_call version (2.1.0) which is more efficient
          in memory use and can read BAMs and write BCFs natively.
          The new bs_call requires a faidx indexed reference, so gemBS
          no creates this during indexing.
    3.4.0 Add switches to give more control to threads and memory
          usage in mapping and calling stages
    3.3.3 Remove legacy pathway for config files with no header line (fix issue 'error in gemBS index #65)
    3.3.2 Fix error where header line for wig files could be omitted
    3.3.2 Fix generation of non_cpg files
    3.3.1 Fix Attribute error bug due to not checking if conversion is a list
    3.3.0 Make new release for IHEC
    3.3.0 Switch conversion default in IHEC_standard configuration to 0.01,0.05 rather than auto, which can give odd results if conversion controls not present or not working correctly
    3.3.0 Fix bug where conversion parameters could be ignored
    3.2.13 Fix formatting bug in mextr with multiple samples (not triggered in normal gemBS use)
    3.2.12 Ensure that conversion statistics are correctly calculated for non-stranded or reverse conversion protocols
    3.2.11 Introduce reverse_conversion option for mapping where read 1 is G2A converted and read 2 is C2T converted
    3.2.10 Correct regex patch for single end reads
    3.2.9 Update Singularity and Dockerfile recipes to allow kemp utils to be built correctly
    3.2.9 Make setup.py and gemBS/commands.py read the version information from gemBS/version.py, so ensuring consistency
    3.2.9 Fix bug added in last version where options in config file were not being taken into account
    3.2.8 Fix mis specification errors in long options for mextr. 
    3.2.8 Fix bug where mextr (methyl extract plugin for bcftools) would crash if cpg output  option was not set.
    3.2.7 Apply patches for bugs in handling single end reads (suggested by I. Moghul)
    3.2.7 Changed regex for filenames to make it more general (suggested by I. Moghul)
    3.2.7 Fixed bug (reported by chhylp123) where zero arguments to some options were being ignored
    3.2.6 Cleaned up compilation and cleaning of gemBS tools
    3.2.6 Fixed python error if either the over conversion reference sequence was not defined
    3.2.6 Added check in bs_call that conversion parameters are valid (between 0 and 1)
    3.2.6 Perform more stringent sanity checking on conversion vaalues when autocomputed by gemBS
    3.2.6 Use --diasble-lzma configuration flag for samtools and bcftools as we don't need it and it removes an unneccesary dependency
    3.2.6 Add install options --disable-cuda (on by default) and --enable-cuda that affect GEM3 comppilation
    3.2.6 Bug fix with incorrect handling of duplicate reads
    3.2.5 Minor bug fix - correct error with non-paired end non-bisulfite reads
    3.2.4 Modify the bisulfite processing in gem-mapper to be more efficient (in particular for the non-stranded option)
    3.2.4 Modify gemBS to use the new conversion options for gem-mapper
    3.2.4 Switch gem-mapper to use option --underconversion-sequence and --overconversion-sequence rather than --underconversion_sequence to be consistent with other options
    3.2.3 Fixed bug if conversion parameters were not set
    3.2.2 Rework non-stranded mode so that both possible conversions are tried and the results merged
    3.2.2 Fix bug where non-stranded flag was not being passed to mapper in paired end mode
    3.2.1 Move warning message from bscall from stdout to stderr
    3.2.1 Switch Singularity build to use Ubuntu 16.04 rather than 18.04 to allow the image to work in CentOS 6 (Docker build changed as well to keep the two in sync)
